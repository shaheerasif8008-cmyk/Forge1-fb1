entitlement_check = await pricing_engine.check_entitlements(
    customer_id="customer_123",
    resource_name="api_calls",
    requested_quantity=100
)

if entitlement_check["entitled"]:
    # Proceed with resource access
    pass
else:
    # Handle overage or upgrade requirement
    pass
```

#### Invoice Generation

    strategy=OptimizationStrategy.BALANCED
)

if recommendation.confidence_score > 0.8:
    # Execute scaling action
    await execute_scaling_action(recommendation)
```

#### Model Cost Routing
```python
# Optimize AI model selection based on requirements and cost
model_recommendation = await capacity_optimizer.optimize_model_routing(
    task_complexity="medium",
    quality_requirement="high",
    latency_requirement="standard",
    budget_constraint=Decimal('100.00')
)

| Enterprise | Critical | 30 minutes | 8 hours |
| Premium | Emergency | 30 minutes | 8 hours |
| Premium | Critical | 1 hour | 24 hours |
| Standard | Critical | 2 hours | 48 hours |

#### Incident Management
```python
# Create and manage system incidents
incident = await support_system.create_incident(
    title="Database Performance Degradation",
    description="High query response times affecting all services",
    severity=IncidentSeverity.SEV2,
    affected_services=["api_server", "web_app"],
    incident_commander="ops_lead",
    affected_customers=500
)
```

#### Rollback Procedures
```python
# Execute automated rollback with approval controls
rollback_result = await support_system.execute_rollback(
    plan_id="app_rollback_v1",
    executed_by="ops_engineer",
    approval_override=False  # Requires proper approval
)

if rollback_result["success"]:
    print(f"Rollback completed in {rollback_result['execution_duration_seconds']}s")
```
