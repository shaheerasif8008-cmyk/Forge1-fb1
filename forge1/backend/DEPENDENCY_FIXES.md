# Dependency Fixes for Forge1 Backend

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Unavailable Dependencies

**Problem**: The following packages were not available on PyPI and were blocking Docker builds:
- `workflows-py>=0.1.0,<0.2.0`
- `opa-python-client>=1.0.0`

**Solution**: 
- Removed `workflows-py` dependency and added comment about using native Python async/await
- Removed `opa-python-client` and added comment about using standard HTTP client for OPA integration
- Created stub implementations to prevent import errors

### 2. Updated Azure Monitor Dependencies

**Problem**: Azure Monitor packages were using versions that might not be available.

**Solution**:
- Updated to `azure-monitor-opentelemetry>=1.0.0` (more stable version)
- Removed `azure-monitor-query>=1.2.0` (not essential for basic functionality)
- Kept `azure-core>=1.29.0` for core Azure functionality

### 3. Added Graceful Import Handling

**Problem**: Missing dependencies would cause import errors and prevent the application from starting.

**Solution**:
- Added try/catch blocks around all Azure Monitor imports
- Created stub implementations for missing services
- Updated main.py to conditionally include routers and middleware
- Added proper logging for missing components

## Files Modified

### Core Dependencies
- `forge1/backend/pyproject.toml` - Removed problematic dependencies

### Stub Implementations Created
- `forge1/backend/forge1/integrations/mcae_adapter.py` - MCAE adapter stub
- `forge1/backend/forge1/integrations/mcae_error_handler.py` - MCAE error handler stub
- `forge1/backend/forge1/middleware/azure_monitor_middleware.py` - Simplified Azure Monitor middleware

### Import Handling Updates
- `forge1/backend/forge1/main.py` - Added conditional imports and graceful degradation
- `forge1/backend/forge1/api/v1/analytics.py` - Added graceful fallbacks for missing services

### Testing and Verification
- `forge1/backend/test_startup.py` - Startup test script to verify imports
- `forge1/backend/DEPENDENCY_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Current Status

âœ… **Fixed Issues**:
- Removed all unavailable PyPI packages
- Added graceful degradation for missing Azure Monitor SDK
- Created stub implementations to prevent import errors
- Updated main.py to handle missing components gracefully

âœ… **Application Should Now**:
- Build successfully in Docker
- Start without import errors
- Provide basic functionality even without Azure Monitor
- Log warnings for missing optional components
- Include full Azure Monitor functionality when SDK is available

## Testing

Run the startup test to verify all imports work:

```bash
cd forge1/backend
python test_startup.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Docker Image**: The pyproject.toml changes should allow clean pip install
2. **Start Backend**: The application should start without import errors
3. **Verify Functionality**: Check that basic endpoints work
4. **Optional**: Install Azure Monitor SDK for full telemetry functionality

## Azure Monitor Integration

The Azure Monitor integration is designed to work in three modes:

1. **Full Integration**: When `azure-monitor-opentelemetry` is installed
   - Complete telemetry collection
   - Advanced analytics and dashboards
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting

2. **Basic Integration**: When only core packages are available
   - Basic request logging
   - Simple performance metrics
   - Health checks

3. **Stub Mode**: When no Azure packages are available
   - Application still functions
   - Logs warnings about missing functionality
   - Provides mock responses for API endpoints

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test imports
python -c "from forge1.main import app; print('âœ… Main app import successful')"

# Test startup
python test_startup.py

# Test specific components
python -c "from forge1.api.v1.analytics import router; print('âœ… Analytics API available')"
python -c "from forge1.middleware.azure_monitor_middleware import AzureMonitorMiddleware; print('âœ… Azure Monitor middleware available')"
```

The backend should now build and start successfully! ðŸŽ‰
