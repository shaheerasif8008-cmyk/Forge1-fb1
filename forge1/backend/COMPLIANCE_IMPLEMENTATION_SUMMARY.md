### HIPAA Compliance

#### Security Rule Safeguards
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Security officer, workforce training, access management

#### PHI Access Logging
```python
# Log PHI access with full audit trail
access_log_id = await hipaa_manager.log_phi_access(
    user_id="doctor_123",
    patient_id="patient_456",
    action="view",
    phi_categories=[PHICategory.NAMES, PHICategory.MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBERS],
    data_accessed="Patient medical record",
    purpose="Treatment"
)
```

#### Breach Notification
- Automatic breach assessment (500+ individual threshold)
- HHS notification requirements (60 days)
- Individual notification (60 days)
- Media notification for large breaches
- State attorney general notification

### Unified Compliance Management

#### Cross-Framework Integration
```python
# Unified compliance assessment
assessment = await unified_manager.run_comprehensive_assessment()

# Overall compliance score calculation
overall_score = assessment.overall_compliance_score  # Weighted across frameworks
risk_score = assessment.risk_score  # Aggregated risk assessment
```

#### Executive Reporting
- Real-time compliance dashboards
- Executive summary reports
- Risk trend analysis
- Regulatory deadline tracking
- Automated alert generation

## Data Models

### GDPR Data Models
- `ConsentRecord`: Individual consent tracking
- `DataProcessingRecord`: ROPA entries
- `DataSubjectRequest`: Rights request management

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Controls
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Real-time control execution
- Automated evidence collection
- Exception handling and escalation

### Risk Assessment
```python
# Risk calculation across frameworks
risk_factors = {
    "soc2": non_compliant_controls * 10,
    "gdpr": overdue_requests * 5 + breaches * 15,
    "hipaa": unresolved_incidents * 10 + pending_notifications * 20
}
overall_risk = min(sum(risk_factors.values()), 100)
```

### Alerting System
