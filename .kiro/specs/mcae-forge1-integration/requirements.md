# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine (MCAE) as the orchestration spine for Forge1, transforming two separate coexisting projects into a unified enterprise AI platform. MCAE will handle multi-agent workflows, tool execution, and collaboration, while Forge1 maintains its role as the enterprise shell providing tenancy, isolation, memory management, and compliance features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Forge1 administrator, I want MCAE to become the orchestration engine so that employee workflows are managed through a robust multi-agent system while maintaining enterprise-grade isolation and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI employee is created in Forge1 THEN the employee SHALL be registered in MCAE with their workflow configuration
2. WHEN MCAE executes workflows THEN it SHALL use Forge1's tenant_id and employee_id context for all operations
3. WHEN MCAE requests model inference THEN it SHALL route through Forge1's model router, not direct model calls
4. WHEN MCAE accesses memory THEN it SHALL use Forge1's memory manager with proper tenant isolation
5. IF MCAE workflows cross tenant boundaries THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with an authorization error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tenant administrator, I want employee-specific MCAE behavior so that each AI employee operates according to their configured system prompts, model preferences, and tool access permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCAE initializes an employee workflow THEN it SHALL load the employee's system_prompt from Forge1's ai_employees table
2. WHEN MCAE selects models for an employee THEN it SHALL respect the employee's model_preferences configuration
3. WHEN MCAE attempts tool execution THEN it SHALL validate against the employee's tool_access permissions
4. WHEN an employee's configuration changes THEN MCAE SHALL update its internal agent configuration accordingly
5. IF an employee lacks permission for a tool THEN MCAE SHALL skip that tool and log the access denial

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want MCAE workflows to enforce Forge1's security policies so that no data, memory, or workflow execution crosses tenant or employee boundaries inappropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCAE accesses Redis cache THEN it SHALL use Forge1's tenant-prefixed keys
2. WHEN MCAE stores workflow state THEN it SHALL apply row-level security with tenant_id and employee_id
3. WHEN MCAE executes tools THEN tool adapters SHALL be tenant-aware and employee-aware
4. WHEN MCAE handles memory operations THEN it SHALL enforce the same isolation as Forge1's memory manager
5. IF MCAE detects cross-tenant data access THEN it SHALL immediately terminate the workflow and alert security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear integration points between MCAE and Forge1 so that the orchestration handoff is seamless and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Forge1's employee_manager creates an employee THEN it SHALL call MCAE's agent registration API
2. WHEN Forge1's model_router receives requests THEN it SHALL handle both direct calls and MCAE-proxied requests
3. WHEN Forge1's memory_manager is accessed THEN it SHALL support both Forge1 and MCAE calling patterns
4. WHEN MCAE needs tenant context THEN it SHALL receive it through standardized context injection
5. IF integration points fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade with appropriate error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a law firm client, I want to create a complete workflow (Intake → Lawyer → Research) that runs under MCAE orchestration so that my employees can collaborate seamlessly while maintaining data isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create three AI employees (Intake, Lawyer, Research) THEN each SHALL be registered in MCAE with their specific roles
2. WHEN a document is submitted to Intake THEN MCAE SHALL orchestrate the handoff to Lawyer with proper context
3. WHEN Lawyer needs research THEN MCAE SHALL delegate to Research employee while maintaining case context
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN all memory and artifacts SHALL remain isolated to my tenant
5. IF another tenant has similar employees THEN their workflows SHALL run independently with no data crossover

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to identify and remove redundant orchestration code from Forge1 so that MCAE becomes the single source of truth for workflow management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCAE integration is complete THEN Forge1's old orchestration logic SHALL be marked for removal
2. WHEN workflow execution occurs THEN it SHALL use MCAE's orchestration, not Forge1's legacy patterns
3. WHEN code review is performed THEN redundant orchestration modules SHALL be clearly identified
4. WHEN refactoring occurs THEN essential Forge1 orchestration SHALL be preserved only where it provides enterprise features MCAE lacks
5. IF legacy orchestration conflicts with MCAE THEN the legacy code SHALL be disabled or removed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an AI employee, I want access to a curated tool belt through MCAE so that I can perform document parsing, vector search, Slack posting, and Drive fetching while respecting tenant boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to parse a document THEN MCAE SHALL provide a tenant-aware document parsing tool
2. WHEN I perform vector search THEN the tool SHALL only search within my tenant's data scope
3. WHEN I post to Slack THEN the tool SHALL use tenant-specific Slack credentials and channels
4. WHEN I fetch from Drive THEN the tool SHALL access only tenant-authorized Drive locations
5. IF I attempt unauthorized tool access THEN MCAE SHALL deny the request and log the attempt

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want runtime confirmation that MCAE is functionally integrated so that I can verify the integration is working, not just colocated in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Forge1 starts up THEN it SHALL import and initialize MCAE modules
2. WHEN employee workflows execute THEN logs SHALL show MCAE orchestration activity
3. WHEN I inspect running processes THEN MCAE agents SHALL be active and handling Forge1 requests
4. WHEN I review code imports THEN Forge1 modules SHALL explicitly import from MCAE packages
5. IF MCAE is not functionally integrated THEN startup health checks SHALL fail with clear error messages
