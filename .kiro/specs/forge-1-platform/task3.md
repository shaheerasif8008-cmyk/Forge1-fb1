# Forge1 Completion Plan (Task 3)

This plan enumerates concrete, verifiable steps to complete Forge1 in alignment with the “AI Employee Factory” spec. Steps are grouped by phase and mapped to deliverables. Each step includes definition of done (DoD) and suggested validation.

## Phase 0 — Repository, Environments, and Baseline

- Bootstrap CI/CD
  - Do: Add GitHub Actions workflows for: lint/test (backend/frontend), Docker build, security scan (Trivy), Helm chart lint, Terraform fmt/validate.
  - DoD: Green pipelines on PR; artifacts for backend/frontend images published to registry.
  - Validate: `gh run list`, verify container digests and SBOMs.

- Dev/Prod config hardening
  - Do: Centralize `.env` templates, pin all Docker base images, add Renovate/Bandit/Snyk config.
  - DoD: Reproducible builds; dependency update PRs generated.
  - Validate: `docker compose build` reproducible; Renovate runs.

- Documentation alignment
  - Do: Ensure README, VERIFY_LOCAL.md, Master Handbook sections match actual paths (docs, tests, scripts). Link to upstream Microsoft accelerator and note extension points.
  - DoD: New contributor can set up and run e2e locally in <30 minutes.
  - Validate: Fresh machine run of `./forge1/scripts/e2e_full.sh` succeeds.

## Phase 1 — Core Orchestration, Memory, and RAG (Near Done)

- Durable orchestration backbone
  - Do: Finalize `forge1/core/orchestration.py` with retry/circuit breaker/outbox patterns; add idempotency keys and exactly-once semantics.
  - DoD: Unit tests pass (`forge1/backend/forge1/tests/test_orchestration_*.py`), integration demo runs via API endpoint.
  - Validate: Chaos tests simulate failures; tasks complete exactly once.

- Advanced memory layer
  - Do: Wire Postgres + Redis; add vector DB adapters (Pinecone, Weaviate, PgVector). Implement memory CRUD, semantic search, context compression, selective sharing.
  - DoD: `MEMORY_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` features covered; perf budget documented (P95 latency, token costs).
  - Validate: Memory tests + retrieval quality benchmarks (NDCG/MRR) meet thresholds.

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Do: Implement ingestion pipeline (chunking, embeddings, metadata), retrieval policy, and augmentation in agent calls.
  - DoD: Toggleable RAG per task; evaluation suite shows quality lift vs. no-RAG baseline.
  - Validate: Offline eval using held‑out docs; regression gating in CI.

- Multi‑model router v1
  - Do: Extend router to expose pluggable adapters; maintain cost/perf telemetry; implement failover and degradation handling.
  - DoD: Supports GPT‑4o/4o‑mini, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, and Open‑Source; routing decisions logged with rationale.
  - Validate: Synthetic task matrix proves routing correctness and cost savings.

## Phase 2 — AI Employee Builder UI + Tool Library

- Employee builder UX
  - Do: Next.js app pages for template selection (HR/Legal/Finance/Marketing/Ops/SDR), drag‑and‑drop workflow composer, persona editor (tone/style/authority), tool picker.
  - DoD: Users can create an employee config and persist to backend; real agents spin up from saved configs (no mocks).
  - Validate: Cypress/Playwright flows cover create/edit/deploy; Lighthouse a11y score ≥ 90.

- Tool integration library
  - Do: Standardized connector SDK (auth, rate‑limit, retries) + prebuilt connectors: HTTP API, Webhook, n8n, Zapier; roadmap placeholders for Slack, Teams, Gmail, CRM, ERP.
  - DoD: Connectors tested with sandbox accounts; secrets via Vault/KeyVault; audit logs captured.
  - Validate: Contract tests; error budgets and retry policies documented.

- Config-to-runtime bridge
  - Do: Translate saved builder configs into orchestrated multi‑agent graphs (AutoGen + CrewAI/LangChain hybrid) with handoff protocols and shared context.
  - DoD: Graphs can be executed, paused, resumed; state persisted; self‑healing on transient failures.
  - Validate: Scenario tests for each template vertical complete end‑to‑end jobs.

## Phase 3 — Multi‑Tenant Auth, Security, and Dashboards

- AuthN/Z & tenancy
  - Do: Implement JWT + OAuth2 (Auth0/Azure AD) with tenant isolation; RBAC (admin, manager, analyst, viewer); per‑tenant rate limits and quotas.
  - DoD: Backend enforces tenant boundaries at data and execution layers; tenancy tests pass.
  - Validate: Pen tests for cross‑tenant access; audit trail review.

- Compliance & auditability
  - Do: Data classification, DLP policies, encryption at rest/in transit, audit logs for all actions, retention & deletion workflows.
  - DoD: SOC2/GDPR/HIPAA readiness checklist met; evidence stored.
  - Validate: Automated compliance checks in CI; sample auditor report generation.

- Premium dashboards
  - Do: Real‑time performance, cost, and ROI analytics per employee/tenant; trend charts; anomaly detection; A/B comparison UI.
  - DoD: Product metrics accessible with drill‑downs; exportable reports; alerts configurable.
  - Validate: Backfilled metrics; correctness cross‑checked with Prometheus/Grafana.

## Phase 4 — Testing Framework and Closed Beta

- Test strategy
  - Do: Expand unit/integration/e2e coverage; contract tests for adapters; load tests for “extreme workload” scenarios; chaos experiments.
  - DoD: Coverage ≥ 80% on critical paths; SLOs defined (availability, latency, error rate).
  - Validate: K6/Locust runs; failure injection proves resilience.

- Eval & benchmarking
  - Do: Superhuman performance validation suite (speed, accuracy, quality); cost‑efficiency dashboards.
  - DoD: Documented superiority vs. human baselines; automated regressions block releases.
  - Validate: Periodic eval jobs write to long‑term store; review cadence set.

- Beta readout
  - Do: Pilot with 3–5 tenants across different verticals; gather feedback loops.
  - DoD: Issues triaged, roadmap adjusted; go/no‑go for Phase 5.
  - Validate: NPS/ROI targets met; stability within SLOs.

## Phase 5 — Monitoring, Logging, and Azure AI Foundry

- Observability stack
  - Do: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics; ELK/Opensearch for logs; traces via OpenTelemetry/Jaeger; SLO dashboards with alerting.
  - DoD: On‑call runbooks; alerts routed; dashboards per tenant and per employee.

  - DoD: Closed‑loop improvements observable in metrics; governance guardrails in place.
  - Validate: A/B tests show uplift; rollback paths exist.

- AI CEO/overseer agent
  - Do: Supervisory agent for cross‑employee coordination, prioritization, and escalation policies.
  - DoD: Overseer optimizes throughput and cost across tenants while respecting quotas.
  - Validate: Scenario sims show improved completion time and cost per job.

## Phase 7 — Enterprise Expansion (EaaS, Portal, Compliance)

- API‑first EaaS
  - Do: Public, versioned APIs to provision/manage employees, jobs, data sources; SDKs (TS/Python); usage metering and billing hooks.
  - DoD: RBAC‑scoped API keys; rate limits; audit logging.
  - Validate: SDK contract tests; tenant‑scoped load tests.

- Enterprise portal
  - Do: SSO/SAML, org hierarchies, approvals, data residency controls, legal/compliance packs.
  - DoD: Enterprise onboarding guide; compliance evidence mapped to controls.
  - Validate: Customer UAT sign‑off.

## Cross‑Cutting Requirements

- Multi‑model routing (adapters)
  - Include GPT‑4o/5, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek R1, Qwen; define adapter interface, benchmarking harness, cost tracker, failover policy.

- Async execution
  - Provide Celery + Redis path and Azure Durable Functions path behind a common abstraction; feature flag selection per env.

- Secrets management
  - Standardize on HashiCorp Vault + Azure KeyVault; rotate keys; dynamic creds for DBs; no secrets in code.

- Connectors
  - Ship core set now (HTTP, Webhook, n8n, Zapier) and design stubs for Slack, Teams, Gmail, Salesforce/HubSpot, SAP/Oracle.

- Security
  - Static analysis, deps scanning, container scanning; policy as code (OPA); zero‑trust network segmentation; per‑tenant encryption contexts.
