# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Forge 1 is Cognisia's flagship AI employee builder platform designed to create and deploy specialized autonomous agents that significantly outperform professional human employees across industries. Built on top of Microsoft's Multi-Agent-Custom-Automation-Engine-Solution-Accelerator, Forge 1 extends the base framework with enterprise-grade capabilities, multi-model routing, advanced memory systems, and a comprehensive client dashboard. The platform targets premium enterprise clients willing to pay $200K+ per month for superhuman AI employees that can handle extreme corporate workloads while maintaining full compliance with data security and privacy regulations, positioning itself as the engine for Cognisia's Employee-as-a-Service (EaaS) model.
