# AI Employee Lifecycle Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete AI employee lifecycle system for Forge1, enabling clients to create, manage, and interact with unique AI employees that have isolated memory, personalized behavior, and scalable architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Client Onboarding and Employee Creation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to onboard new clients and create tailored AI employees based on their specific requirements, so that each client gets employees perfectly suited to their needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new client is onboarded THEN the system SHALL create a unique tenant_id and client configuration
2. WHEN client requirements are provided THEN the system SHALL generate an AI employee with appropriate name, role, goals, and capabilities
3. WHEN an employee is created THEN the system SHALL assign it exclusively to one client with proper isolation
4. IF employee requirements include specific tools THEN the system SHALL configure tool access for that employee
5. WHEN employee creation is complete THEN the system SHALL return the employee configuration and unique employee_id

### Requirement 2: Employee Memory Isolation

**User Story:** As a client, I want each of my AI employees to have completely isolated memory that never mixes with other employees or clients, so that sensitive information remains secure and conversations stay contextual.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee stores memory THEN the system SHALL tag it with tenant_id and employee_id for complete isolation
2. WHEN retrieving employee memory THEN the system SHALL only return memories belonging to that specific employee
3. WHEN employees from the same client interact THEN their memories SHALL remain separate unless explicitly configured to share
4. IF an employee from one client attempts to access another client's data THEN the system SHALL deny access completely
5. WHEN memory is queried THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security with tenant and employee filters

### Requirement 3: Stateless Employee Operations

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want AI employees to work on-demand without permanent sessions, so that the system can scale efficiently and handle thousands of employees without resource waste.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee interaction begins THEN the system SHALL load employee identity and relevant memory from storage
2. WHEN AI processing occurs THEN the system SHALL use the employee's configured preferences and context
3. WHEN interaction completes THEN the system SHALL save memory updates and release resources
4. IF no interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL not maintain any persistent employee sessions
5. WHEN scaling to many employees THEN the system SHALL perform consistently without manual intervention

### Requirement 4: Employee-Specific Behavior and Preferences

**User Story:** As a client, I want each AI employee to have unique behavior, preferred models, tools, and communication styles that automatically apply during interactions, so that employees feel like distinct individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an employee is created THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of model preferences, tools, and personality traits
2. WHEN an employee processes requests THEN the system SHALL automatically use their configured preferences
3. WHEN employee behavior needs updating THEN the system SHALL allow modification of preferences without affecting other employees
4. IF an employee has specific tool access THEN the system SHALL only provide those tools during interactions
5. WHEN multiple employees exist THEN each SHALL maintain distinct behavior patterns and preferences

### Requirement 5: Multi-Client and Multi-Employee Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle 5 employees or 5,000 employees with the same operational simplicity, so that growth doesn't require manual management or system redesign.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the number of clients increases THEN the system SHALL maintain the same performance and isolation guarantees
2. WHEN employees are added THEN the system SHALL automatically handle resource allocation and memory management
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally without manual intervention
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and alerting for proactive management
5. WHEN operating at scale THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for employee interactions

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Employee Interaction

**User Story:** As a client user, I want to interact with my AI employees through a simple interface where they remember our conversation history and respond according to their configured personality, so that working with them feels natural and productive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a conversation with an employee THEN the system SHALL load their identity and relevant memory context
2. WHEN the employee responds THEN they SHALL use their configured personality, tools, and knowledge sources
3. WHEN our conversation continues THEN the employee SHALL remember previous interactions and build on them
4. IF I return later THEN the employee SHALL recall our conversation history and maintain continuity
5. WHEN the conversation ends THEN the system SHALL save all memory updates for future interactions

### Requirement 7: Client and Employee Management APIs

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive APIs to manage clients and employees programmatically, so that I can build custom interfaces and automate employee lifecycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing clients THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for create, read, update, and delete operations
2. WHEN managing employees THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for employee creation, configuration, and status management
3. WHEN querying employee interactions THEN the system SHALL provide APIs to retrieve conversation history and analytics
4. IF bulk operations are needed THEN the system SHALL support batch creation and management of employees
5. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL provide webhook and event notification capabilities

### Requirement 8: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all employee interactions and data to be properly secured, audited, and compliant with enterprise security requirements, so that we meet regulatory and security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN employee data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it with tenant-specific keys
2. WHEN cross-tenant access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log and block unauthorized access attempts
3. WHEN employee interactions occur THEN the system SHALL create detailed audit logs with timestamps and participants
4. IF compliance policies change THEN the system SHALL support data retention and deletion policies
5. WHEN security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL provide forensic capabilities and incident response tools
