# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Client Onboarding Automation feature enables Forge 1 to automatically configure and deploy specialized AI employees based on client requirements discovered through sales interactions. This system transforms the manual process of AI employee creation into an intelligent, automated workflow that can rapidly provision industry-specific AI workers (such as AI lawyers for law firms) and seamlessly integrate them into client portals. The feature targets mid-to-large enterprises with substantial budgets ($500K-$700K annually) who need multiple specialized AI employees deployed quickly and efficiently.
