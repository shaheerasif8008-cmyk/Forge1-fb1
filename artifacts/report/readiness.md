## Strengths
- Healthy foundations: sanitized imports, live health/metrics endpoints, and clean static/security scans.
- End-to-end workflows with policy enforcement, observability, and billing instrumentation wired through the tool layer.
- Deterministic performance and accuracy evidence bundles suitable for compliance review.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Integration tests require running Postgres and Redis instances; ensure those services are started (for example via docker-compose) before executing the full suite.
- Telemetry exporters default to console when OTLP collectors are unavailable; production deployments must configure OTEL endpoints.

## Backlog
| Priority | Item | ETA | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M | Automate Postgres/Redis provisioning in CI pipelines | 3 days | Provide docker-compose hooks or Testcontainers so foundations tests run without manual setup. |
| M | Harden OTLP exporter configuration | 2 days | Document collector endpoints and add smoke validation to detect misconfiguration early. |
| L | Expose environment toggles for real Slack/Email connectors | 1 week | Adapters ship with mock defaults; document production secrets and toggles for real integrations. |

## Environment Notes
- Run `docker-compose up -d db redis` (or equivalent) before executing foundations tests to satisfy database and cache dependencies.
- Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and credentials in production to ship traces and metrics to your observability backend.
