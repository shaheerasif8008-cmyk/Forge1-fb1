# Forge1 Readiness & Gap Report

- **Assessment Date (UTC):** $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
- **Overall Readiness Score:** 15%
- **Recommendation:** **NO-GO** – core services fail static validation, automated tests, and operational checks.

## Executive Summary
- Static analysis uncovered 1,682 Ruff offenses, 1,187 Bandit findings, and 17 gitleaks secret exposures (see `artifacts/static/phase1_summary.json`). Numerous modules fail to import because several files are plain text rather than Python modules (for example `forge1/backend/verify_security_compliance.py:1`).
- Backend initialization currently raises a runtime exception: `forge1/core/app_kernel.py:736` references an undefined `logger`. Critical modules such as `forge1/core/memory/memgpt_summarizer.py` are missing, which breaks tenant memory services and all pytest entrypoints.
- Docker Compose stack reports "limited functionality" from `/health`, and Prometheus marks every service target as `down` because `/metrics` endpoints return `404` (see `artifacts/phase5_prometheus_targets.json`). No tenants or documents could be seeded.
- End-to-end NDA flow can only be simulated via mocked script output; Finance P&L automation has no executable path. Load and chaos tests fail immediately due to the app kernel bug. Security, compliance, and accuracy validations remain unexecuted.

## Phase Outcomes
| Phase | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 – Prep & Inventory | ✅ Completed (inventory + graph) | `artifacts/inventory.json`, `artifacts/dependency-graph.svg` |
| Phase 1 – Static Quality Gate | ❌ Failed | `artifacts/static/phase1_summary.json`, `artifacts/static/ruff.json`, `artifacts/static/bandit.json`, `artifacts/static/gitleaks.json` |
| Phase 2 – Unit & Contract Tests | ❌ Blocked (imports crash) | `artifacts/static/pytest.log` |
| Phase 3 – Integration Wiring | ⚠️ Partial (stack up, seeding failed) | `artifacts/phase3_docker_up.log`, `artifacts/seed_manifest.json`, `artifacts/phase3_backend_logs.log` |
| Phase 4 – End-to-End Flows | ⚠️ Partial (simulated NDA only) | `artifacts/phase4/`, `artifacts/phase4_summary.json` |
| Phase 5 – Observability & Billing | ❌ Failed (targets down, no billing) | `artifacts/phase5_prometheus_targets.json`, `artifacts/phase5_summary.json` |
| Phase 6 – Performance & Chaos | ❌ Failed (app kernel crash) | `artifacts/phase6_loadtest.log`, `artifacts/phase6_summary.json` |
| Phase 7 – Security & Compliance | ❌ Failed (scripts non-executable, secrets exposed) | `artifacts/phase7_summary.json`, `artifacts/static/gitleaks.json` |
| Phase 8 – Accuracy & KPIs | ❌ Not run | `artifacts/phase8_summary.json` |
| Phase 9 – Evidence Bundle | ✅ Generated | `artifacts/forge1_evidence_*.tar.gz` |

## Critical Gaps (Severity **S**)
1. **Backend bootstrap crashes** – `forge1/backend/forge1/core/app_kernel.py:736` calls `logger.info` before `logger` is defined, causing load tests and imports to fail (`artifacts/phase6_loadtest.log`).
2. **Missing core modules** – `forge1/backend/forge1/services/employee_memory_manager.py:23` imports `forge1.core.memory.memgpt_summarizer` which does not exist, blocking pytest and real memory operations (`artifacts/static/pytest.log`).
3. **Broken compliance/security scripts** – Files like `forge1/backend/verify_security_compliance.py:1` and `forge1/backend/verify_superhuman_performance.py` contain prose instead of Python, leaving mandated validations unimplemented (flagged as `invalid-syntax` in `artifacts/static/ruff.json`).
4. **Secrets exposed in repository** – 17 gitleaks findings including `.env` credentials (example: `forge1/.env.example:12` includes `forge1_db_pass`; see `artifacts/static/gitleaks.json`).
5. **Observability stack unusable** – Prometheus reports every application target as `down` (no `/metrics` endpoint; see `artifacts/phase5_prometheus_targets.json`), meaning no SLA/SLO evidence can be collected.

## Major Gaps (Severity **M**)
1. **Health endpoint admits degraded mode** – `/health` returns "Running with limited functionality due to missing dependencies" (captured in `artifacts/seed_manifest.json`).
2. **Test suite regressions** – pytest halts during import due to missing modules and syntax errors; coverage cannot be measured (Phase 2).
3. **Billing/usage reconciliation absent** – No OpenMeter deployment or export pipeline; billing accuracy can’t be verified (Phase 5).
4. **Finance P&L workflow missing** – No scripts or APIs implement the required flow; documentation only.

## Minor Gaps (Severity **L**)
1. **Obsolete Docker Compose version attribute** – Compose warns about deprecated `version` field (`artifacts/phase3_docker_up.log`).
2. **Prometheus target misconfiguration** – Node/postgres/redis scrapes point to non-existent exporters; should be removed or replaced (Phase 5).

## Metrics & Evidence Snapshots
- **Static Scan Totals:** Ruff=1,682 offenses, Bandit=1,187 (including high severity), Gitleaks=17, Mypy=1 fatal syntax (`artifacts/static/phase1_summary.json`).
- **Load Test Failure:** `scripts/load_test.py` aborts with `NameError: logger` (`artifacts/phase6_loadtest.log`).
- **Prometheus Health:** All service targets `health=down`, 404 errors on `/metrics` (`artifacts/phase5_prometheus_targets.json`).
- **NDA Demo Output:** Simulated run only; artifacts stored under `artifacts/phase4/`.

## Recommended Next Actions & ETA
1. **Restore executable code paths (1–2 weeks)** – Define logger in `forge1/core/app_kernel.py`, add missing memory modules, convert compliance scripts into real test suites.
2. **Remediate security exposures (1 week)** – Rotate exposed credentials, remove secrets from repo, add automated pre-commit scanning.
3. **Rebuild observability & billing (2–3 weeks)** – Implement `/metrics`, deploy exporters, configure OpenMeter + reconciliation tests.
4. **Stabilize automated testing (1–2 weeks)** – Ensure pytest imports succeed, add CI gate, achieve ≥85% coverage.
5. **Deliver real end-to-end workflows (3–4 weeks)** – Implement Finance P&L flow and integrate actual services rather than mocks.

## Go/No-Go Decision
With multiple critical defects across security, runtime stability, observability, and testing, Forge1 does **not** meet the 95% readiness requirement. Proceeding to production would violate the acceptance criteria and pose significant operational risk.
