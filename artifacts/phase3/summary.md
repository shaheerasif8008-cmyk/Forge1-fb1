# Phase 3 Observability Summary

- OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation now initializes for FastAPI, Celery, Redis, httpx/requests, and psycopg via `forge1.observability.setup_observability` with OTLP exporters and console fallback support.
- Added unit tests verifying span export and configuration behavior under `tests/observability/test_otel.py`.
- Captured evidence artifacts:
  - `artifacts/obs/traces.json` – synthetic trace exported through the configured tracer provider.
  - `artifacts/obs/prometheus_snapshot.txt` – Prometheus scrape output from the `/metrics` endpoint.
  - `artifacts/obs/grafana_dashboard.json` & `artifacts/obs/grafana_overview.png` – committed Grafana dashboard definition and visual layout preview.

The instrumentation is idempotent, exposes resource metadata (service name/version/environment), and gracefully un-instruments on shutdown for tests.
