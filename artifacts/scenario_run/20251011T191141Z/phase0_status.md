# Phase 0 Status

**Result:** FAILED

**Reason:** The evaluation environment only contains the source repository without any running Forge1 services or deployment artifacts. Required components such as MCAE, LlamaIndex services, Workflow engine, OPA server, observability stack, and billing pipeline are not provisioned, and there are no scripts or documentation enabling automated bootstrap from this workspace. Because Phase 0 depends on connecting to live services to interrogate runtime profiles and enumerate inventory, it cannot be executed.

**Next Steps to Enable Phase 0**
1. Provide deployment manifests or docker-compose definitions that start the Forge1 reference stack locally.
2. Supply credentials and configuration files necessary for the MCAE control plane, OPA policies, observability exporters, and billing collectors.
3. Once services are running, rerun Phase 0 commands to gather the inventory and dependency data.

**Evidence Collected:** None â€” runtime endpoints absent.
