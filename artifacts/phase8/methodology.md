# Phase 8 Accuracy & KPI Evaluation

- Legal evaluation passed: True
- Finance evaluation passed: True

## Methodology

Indexed deterministic NDA clauses into the local KB adapter and executed three legal queries. Precision@5 is computed per query over retrieved clause identifiers, and the hallucination rate captures unsupported key points emitted from retrieved results.

Aggregated deterministic ERP revenue and expense samples to compute total revenue, expenses, net profit, and profit margin. Variance is measured against the curated ground-truth ledger with a 1% tolerance.
