# Gate Failure Summary

- **Failing Gate:** Phase 0 — Environment & Snapshot.
- **Blocking Issue:** No running Forge1 services are available in this workspace. The repository lacks deployment scripts or infrastructure automation to start MCAE, LlamaIndex, Workflows, OPA, observability, billing, and related components required for runtime inspection.
- **Minimal Change Needed:** Provide or execute an environment bootstrap (e.g., `docker-compose up` or `helm install` across the stack) so that endpoints such as `/health`, `/metrics`, MCAE APIs, and billing collectors are reachable.
- **Commands to Rerun Phase 0:**
  ```bash
  # After the runtime stack is provisioned
  # 1. Activate Forge1 environment (example command – replace with actual bootstrap)
  ./scripts/start_forge1_stack.sh

  # 2. Re-run Phase 0 data collection tooling
  python tools/collect_inventory.py --output artifacts/scenario_run/<timestamp>
  ```

Until the runtime stack exists, subsequent phases (tenant setup, E2E flows, policy validation, observability, billing, performance, accuracy) cannot be attempted without fabricating evidence.
