# Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine Solution Accelerator

Welcome to the *Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine* solution accelerator, designed to help businesses leverage AI agents for automating complex organizational tasks. This accelerator provides a foundation for building AI-driven orchestration systems that can coordinate multiple specialized agents to accomplish various business processes.

When dealing with complex organizational tasks, users often face significant challenges, including coordinating across multiple departments, maintaining consistency in processes, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

The Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine solution accelerator allows users to specify tasks and have them automatically processed by a group of AI agents, each specialized in different aspects of the business. This automation not only saves time but also ensures accuracy and consistency in task execution.

### Prerequisites and Costs

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups and resources**. Follow the steps in [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md).

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) page and select a **region** where the following services are available: Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, and Azure Semantic Search.

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Japan East, UK South, Sweden Central.

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. [Review a sample pricing sheet for the architecture](https://azure.com/e/86d0eefbe4dd4a23981c1d3d4f6fe7ed).
| Product | Description | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) | Powers the AI agents for task automation | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/) |
| [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/) | Hosts the web application frontend | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/) |
| [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/) | Stores metadata and processing results | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cosmos-db/) |
| [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) | Stores container images for deployment | [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/) |

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
